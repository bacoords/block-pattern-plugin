# Block Pattern Plugin

Experimental plugin to store some pattern management features. This should never be used in production.

## Features

### Block Pattern Group Block Scaffold (Group Block Variation)

Scaffold for a group block that has a full-width pattern, some padding in it, and then an inner group with content locking.

### View All Patterns Custom Block

A block that will just spit out all of your patterns so you can see what they look like on the front end.

### ContentOnly Lock Toggle

Adds a button to the Group block toolbar to quickly toggle the `contentOnly` lock on and off.
